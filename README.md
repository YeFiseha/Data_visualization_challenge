# Data_visualization_challenge
In this assignment, we compare the performance of a particular drug - Capomulin - against other treatment regimens based on 45-days observation of 249 mice that were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. 
# Summary of results
The average tumor volume of the 249 mice under Capomulin treatment is the second lowest (after the Ramicane treated mice). The variation in tumor volume among the mice is also the second lowest for the mice receiving Capomulin treatment.

The mice receiving Capomulin treatment have been observed for the highest number of times.
The distribution of the mice tumor volume for selected four treatment drugs - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin – shows the followings:
•	Capomulin and Ramicane treated mice have the lowest tumor volume and the range of the rumor volumes is 25 -48mm3 and 22 -46mm3 respectively.
•	Infubinol treated mice have the highest tumor volume ranging between 55-75mm3. There is also one outlier low tumor volume of 36mm3. 
•	Ceftamin treated mice have tumor volumes ranging between 45-67mm3 with no outliers.

A scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for Capomulin treated mice shows that - higher mice weight is positively related to higher tumor volume. That is, the higher the weight of mice the higher tumor they have.

The linear regression and correlation coefficient also show this positive and 1-to-1 relationship between mice weight and average tumor volume for the mice receiving Capomulin treatment.

We may infer from this that losing weight contributes to lowering tumor volume.

•	get the correct number of mice in the clean DataFrame (248),
•	get the last (greatest) timepoint for each mouse and to calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment drugs, and
•	correctly set up the for loop
